# dp-sudoku

##Problem

Prolog and erlang modules of the homework for dynamic programming
See detailed description at http://dp.iit.bme.hu/dp-current/dp16a-nhf.html

##Usage

Download and extract or clone the files to a local folder. 

The erlang module ```sudoku.erl``` can be loaded to the shell directly with

```
c(sudoku).
```

In order to load the prolog module type

```
[sudoku].
```

into the prolog shell. The program is developped with SWI prolog, however it works with SICSTUS just the same.

The modules have no further requirements.

##Other contents

Module <b>KHF</b> contains minor tasks, upon which the final task is built.

Folder **test-inputs** contains some small test cases for manually testing the code. For overall testing see the framework at http://dp.iit.bme.hu/dp-current/dp16a-nhf.html#keret.

The framework for testing both the erlang and the prolog code can be downloaded from here: http://dp.iit.bme.hu/dp-current/dp16a-nhf-ker.zip
